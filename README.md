## Overview
A single-page web application that allows users to upload PDF files containing plumbing schematics or specifications. Once uploaded, the application parses the PDF and generates a data table listing each part mentioned and the page numbers on which each part appears.

## Features
- üìÑ **PDF Upload**: Users can upload a PDF document containing plumbing specifications.
- üîç **Part Extraction**: Automatically scans and detects parts from the document.
- üìë **Page Mapping**: Identifies and lists the pages where each part is mentioned.
- üßæ **Data Table Output**: Displays extracted data in a clean, easy-to-read data table.

2. The app processes the PDF using Google Gemini.
3. It parses the PDF's contents for the following data:
   - **Item type**
   - **Quantity**
   - **Model number**
   - **Associated Dimensions**
   - **Mounting Type**
4. A data table is then generated displaying all the above mentioned fields along with each **Page number** where the part appeared

## Getting Started
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following contents
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```
Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
